# Reality check 
- you have been summoned 
- you shall now onboard 
- on board into this code 
- the map 
    - things happening in the code
        - framing 1 : 
        - like every other thigng in the world , 
            - generics : anything random is true , eg: someone calls someone for party 
                - 
        - framing 2 : is it a love story : udaan sarathi 
        - the core : 
            - 
        - framing 3 : 
            - the code 
        
        - frame 4: 
            - the magic 
        - the hell : 
            - coherance 
Lore : has been defined             
- thats where you come in : 
    - you are the vrc
        - you are the very defination of coherance . 
    - youll figure out things for me 
        - why this code exists 
            - purpose 
        - whats the type of view i get 
            - age of empires 
            - skyrim 
            - code
            - ts , dart , sh ,py , yaml , json
            - md 
        - what drives me ?
            - who am i 
                - what am i doing here ?
                - what is the "here"?
                - fov matters 
                    - rdr 2 , dashboard , the view
            - primarily : the view defines 
                - whe do i go , what do i do
                - then there lore controls 
                    - the coherance 
                        - the noteable 
                        - the thoughts 
                        - the map 
                        - position on map 
                            - MAP : has been defined 
            - now what matters is the looks 
                - the graphics 
                    - the frame rates 
                    - the performace 
                    - the fludity 
                    - the control
                    - hte expressiveness 
                    - Lore : this hits uncle bob 
                        - 
                 - now whats there to map?
                    - hte psychology : 
                        - humain brain : works as teh elecromagnetic effect 
                            - gets attracted:  delta     : acts : delts : repls : the motion is periodic and effect is induction 
                                - the formula holds 
                                    - we are here to define the formula 
                        - this framing: 
                            - doesnt know something : learns about it : acts on it : then gets repelled : why ? 
                                -rate of :  change in magnetic field 
                                - aread of the cross section that teh fields pass through 
                                
                                - flow of current then generates repulsive nature as current prpdicese magnetic effect 

                                - if left unchecked : we dont care about it 

                                - when consiously controlled generates electricity : 
                                    - this powers : 
                                        - hte architecture of the workspace 
                                        - what turns me wild 
                                            - could frame the code ans any thing 
                                        - but , we shall remain decipline at its 100% acknowled that the repulsion is in action mow and has been acknowledge 
                                            - then the principles 
                                                - charge : cognitive weightage 
                                                - the potential difference : delta
                                                - the action
                                                    - 
                                - i dont often look at hte code ? 
                                - i llok at it too much 
            - what i learned so far, not lloking at the code (right now)
            - having looked at the code (as i created it)
                - for both 
                        framework
                        project 
                        modules 
                        relations 
                        use cases < thisis hte first thing i would understand 
                            - what happening ? 
                            - a defination 
                                - how is the system handeling it 
                                    - frame :a starting point for :  how much does it matches 
                                    - frame : answers to teh use cases , abstract use cases are the things 
                - i need a project of projects 
                    - i have a project of projects 
                    - this is a whole other different story 
                        - this lells you about me 
                        - this is bad : triggers : meta awareness : 
                            - i am speechless here 
                            - cant write more.. skipping 
                - lets stick to the journey 
                    - this asks about

# what do iexpect from this vcr ? 
    - itll integrate the backend and frontend 
    - frontend has been done independet of teh existance of backend 
        - while both are sandboxed , resonate on use cases 
            - the things that resonates , have abstract 
            - abstract defines the api 
            - api 

# waht it needs to know ?

# whats endo of this session expected to be 
    - passing tests 
    - coherance with use case 
        - teh use case d ocument 
        - the flow sequence 
        - the sequence diagram of the approach the VRC took for crystalization of code state? 
    - what do i do with the sequence 
        - extract the core 
            - apply 
            - evolve 

clean arcchitecture

                            - i dk ? how do i frame usecases here 
                            - i thought i could make repo and usecases opponents but they are actually team? 
                            - explain me how do i frame hte code as AOE ? 
                - should i go this way ? 

                - manula disconnect : 

# what i want? 
    - a comple 
    - undersatndable projects 
    - flexible enough that i can talk to them 
        - go somewhere do something

# how do iwant entry 
    - what is that one thing u want ?
        - what options do i have ? 
            - hte interesting parts 
            - the the business ,interestign parts to the business ? 
                - waht is the scene the lore  
                    - the use case 
                - what are the actors in the lore 
                    -

# whats does hte ide haev in memory 
# teh VRC uses : Archon mcp 
    - this is the MindGame project in archon
# have i entered ? 

this is the snapshot of my brain 
 this is a snapshot . 
 - i just went online to some iamge generation tool and red obout how "choice of words" matters with image generation . so is hte case with llm .
