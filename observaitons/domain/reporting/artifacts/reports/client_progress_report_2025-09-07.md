# Udaan Saarathi - Progress Report
**Date:** September 7, 2025  
**Target Deployment:** November 22, 2025  
**Project Manager:** Client Stakeholder Update

---

## Project Overview

The **Udaan Saarathi** is a comprehensive workforce management system designed to streamline the connection between recruitment agencies and job candidates. The platform leverages modern web technologies including **NestJS** for robust backend APIs, **React** for responsive frontend experiences, and **PostgreSQL** for reliable data management, all containerized with **Docker** for seamless deployment.
\
Note: The frontend is prototyped independently in the repository path `./UdaanSarathi/` while the backend lives in `./src/` and related modules.

**Core Value Proposition:** Digitizing and automating the entire recruitment lifecycle from agency onboarding to candidate placement, with built-in analytics and multi-domain support.

## Progress Summary

###  What's Done

**Backend Infrastructure (NestJS + TypeORM)**
- Agency Management System: Complete user registration, profile management, and job posting capabilities
- Candidate Management System: Full application processing, candidate filtering, and preference matching
- Domain Management System: Multi-domain support with configuration management
- Application Workflow System: End-to-end application lifecycle management
- Country/Location System: Geographic data management and localization support

**Database & Testing**
- PostgreSQL schema with comprehensive entity relationships
- 101 automated tests across 46 test suites with 100% pass rate
- Docker containerization for development and deployment
- Robust data seeding and migration system

**Frontend Foundation (UdaanSarathi React App)**
- Comprehensive component library and UI utilities
- Error handling and form validation systems
- Service layer architecture for API integration
 - Note: The frontend is prototyped independently in `/UdaanSarathi/` and follows a staggered timeline (backend through Oct 12; UI through Oct 26), with integration and security running in parallel.
 - Start dates: Frontend started ~Aug 24; Backend began ~Aug 31.

###  What's In Progress

**API Integration & Testing**
- Frontend-backend integration testing (in progress; aligned with UI/UX through Oct 26)
- Performance optimization and security hardening (Sep 21 → Nov 7)
- UI/UX component finalization (through Oct 26)
- Client demo preparation (rolling; begins after Oct 12 milestone)

###  What's Next

**Deployment Pipeline (October - November)**
- Complete remaining backend API endpoints
- Integration testing between frontend and backend
- Performance optimization and security hardening
- Client training and go-live preparation
