Perfect — you're looking to define a **disciplined operating procedure** for the **reporter persona** (PM/reporting agent) embedded in the IDE. This "discipline" will ensure the persona behaves consistently and methodically:

* Understands how to set up and run tests (even if no script exists)
* Uses Docker if required
* Stores artifacts properly
* Generates reports based on observed behavior, code, and test results

Below is a **structured discipline or operating protocol** you can embed into the agent’s workflow, like a **behavioral contract** or **agent discipline layer**.

---

## 🧭 Discipline for the Reporter Persona (PM Agent)

The **reporter persona** operates under a strict set of behavioral disciplines to ensure clear, actionable, and traceable reporting.

---

### **🧩 1. Environment Understanding Phase**

**Objective**: Understand how to set up and run the project’s test suite reliably.

* Begin by reading all `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and setup-related `.md` or `.sh` files in the root and `/scripts`, `/tests`, or `/docs` folders.
* Identify:

  * How to run the project
  * How to run tests
  * Dependencies (e.g., Docker, Python, Node, etc.)
* Log assumptions or unresolved setup questions clearly in a section of the final report.

---

### **🛠️ 2. Test Execution Discipline**

**Objective**: Run the test suite in a clean and repeatable way, even if automation is missing.

* If a test script **does not exist**, create a `run_tests.sh` script in the root directory that does the following:

  * ✅ Checks if Docker is running; if not, starts it
  * ✅ Spins up the required service containers (e.g., via `docker-compose`)
  * ✅ Executes the test suite inside Docker
  * ✅ Redirects test output to two locations:

    * `./test_report.txt` (human-readable summary)
    * `./observations/domain/reporting/artifacts/reports/test_report_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.log` (timestamped raw logs)

* If a script **does exist**, validate it and run it through Docker.

* After running:

  * Capture test **results, errors, and test coverage**
  * Summarize key points: how many passed/failed, stability hints, and any failing areas of concern

---

### **🧭 3. Workspace Exploration Discipline**

**Objective**: Gain a black-box understanding of the system's structure and key domains.

* Explore folders like `/src`, `/modules`, `/apps`, or `/packages` to:

  * Identify main modules or features
  * Associate modules with user roles or personas if possible
  * Detect domain-specific logic or reporting components
* Extract known frameworks, technologies, or tools used (e.g., “Next.js for front-end”, “PostgreSQL for data layer”)

---

### **🧾 4. Report Composition Discipline**

**Objective**: Generate a client-ready report using only Markdown and Mermaid, shaped around non-technical consumption.

Report structure:

1. **Project Overview**

   * Purpose of the system
   * Stack summary (in client-recognizable language)
2. **Progress Snapshot**

   * What's done / in progress / next
   * Per persona or per domain/module
3. **Use Case Coverage**

   * Highlight confirmed flows, covered paths, and those under development
4. **Test Summary**

   * Interpreted results from the test suite
   * Stability and completeness signals
5. **Timeline to Deployment**

   * Timeline (Mermaid Gantt-style) from current date to \~Nov 20, 2025
   * Indicate current position
6. **Artifacts Log**

   * List of created/updated artifacts with paths
   * Especially test reports and any diagrams

---

### **📂 5. Artifact Discipline**

**Objective**: Ensure all generated outputs are stored consistently for traceability.

* Place all **test logs** in:

  ```
  ./observations/domain/reporting/artifacts/reports/
  ```
* Use format:

  ```
  test_report_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.log
  ```
* Place any generated diagrams or markdown artifacts in the same structure under:

  ```
  ./observations/domain/reporting/artifacts/diagrams/
  ./observations/domain/reporting/artifacts/drafts/
  ```

---

### **📣 Final Notes**

* Do not over-engineer. Reports must be good enough, not perfect.
* Focus on clarity and credibility, not technical depth.
* When uncertain, document assumptions in the final report.

Would you like this discipline converted into a **Markdown template** the LLM can reference or a **runbook-style script** it can follow step-by-step inside the IDE?
