Got it — you're reporting **project progress** to **non-technical stakeholders** (like a **Project Manager** or **Product Owner**) and the focus is on **clarity, planning, and outcomes**, **not technical details**.

You're looking for **diagrams** or **reporting formats** that:

* Reflect where the team is now
* What has been achieved
* What’s being done
* What's next
* Who's involved (personas)
* What flows/use cases are solidified
* What artifacts (non-code) are or will be produced
* A **clean timeline** to deployment (2.5 months from Sept 7 → \~Nov 20, 2025)

## ✅ Recommended Diagrams for Project Reporting (to PM / PO)

Here’s a breakdown of **diagrams/templates** that are well-suited to your context:

---

### **1. Persona-Centric Overview Diagram**

Shows key **user roles/personas** and their **pain points, goals, and current progress**.

* **Diagram Type:** Annotated Persona Map or Stakeholder Matrix
* **Audience Benefit:** Helps the PM understand *who* the features are being built for, and what's done or pending for each.
* **Structure:**

  ```
  ┌────────────────────┐
  │ Agency Panel User  │
  ├────────────────────┤
  │ ✓ Onboard flow done│
  │ ☐ Reporting pending│
  │ → Currently testing│
  └────────────────────┘

  Repeat for each persona.
  ```

---

### **2. Use Case Coverage Diagram**

Shows what **use cases are defined, in progress, or completed**, linked to personas.

* **Diagram Type:** Use Case Matrix or Visual Use Case Diagram
* **Audience Benefit:** Shows breadth of functional coverage, visually.
* **Example Table:**

| Persona           | Use Case     | Status         |
| ----------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Agency Panel User | Login        | ✅ Done         |
|                   | View Reports | 🟡 In Progress |
|                   | Export Data  | ⬜ Not Started  |
| Admin             | Manage Users | ✅ Done         |

### **3. Timeline (High-Level Gantt or Roadmap)**

From **today (Sept 7)** to **deployment (\~Nov 20)**
Should be **clean, high-level, no technical jargon.**

* **Diagram Type:** Milestone Timeline or Gantt-like Roadmap
* **Audience Benefit:** Provides clarity on progress, upcoming steps, and risks.
* **Structure:**

```plaintext
Sept 7   | Discovery & Alignment [Done]
Sept 15  | Use Case Finalization [In Progress]
Sept 30  | UI Mockups + Stakeholder Signoff
Oct 15   | User Testing (UAT Begins)
Nov 01   | Final Adjustments & QA
Nov 20   | Deployment
```

📝 You can color-code (✅ done, 🔄 in progress, ⬜ upcoming)

---

### **4. Module Black Box Diagram**

Breaks down the **main system components** (no technical internals), with current status.

* **Diagram Type:** Level-1 System Block Diagram (Black-Box View)
* **Audience Benefit:** Understand which modules exist, and their progress without going into architecture.
* **Example:**

```plaintext
┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│  User Module │      │ Reporting    │
│ ✅ Done      │─────▶│ 🟡 In Progress│
└──────────────┘      └──────────────┘
           ┌──────────────┐
           │ Admin Module │
           │ ⬜ Not Started│
           └──────────────┘
```

---

### **5. Artifact Tracker**

List of expected **non-code deliverables**, their status, and what’s next.

* **Diagram Type:** Kanban or Artifact Matrix
* **Audience Benefit:** Clarifies documentation, diagrams, and decision points expected before go-live.
* **Example Table:**

| Artifact Name        | Status        | Owner    | Due Date |
| -------------------- | ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Persona Map          | ✅ Completed   | UX Team  | Sept 5   |
| Use Case List        | 🟡 Drafting   | BA       | Sept 12  |
| UI Wireframes        | ⬜ Not Started | Designer | Sept 18  |
| Deployment Checklist | ⬜ Planned     | Dev Lead | Nov 10   |

## 👇 How to Put It All Together

**Single Reporting Deck or Document (Client-Facing)**
Structure:

1. **Intro Slide/Page** – Objective of this update/report
2. **Persona Overview Diagram**
3. **Use Case Coverage Matrix**
4. **Current Status & Next Steps (per persona/module)**
5. **Timeline to Deployment**
6. **Artifact Tracker**
7. **Risks or Dependencies** (optional but appreciated by PMs)

## 🛠 Tools to Create These Diagrams

* **Miro** – Great for collaborative diagrams (persona maps, timelines)
* **Lucidchart / Whimsical** – Clean, formal diagramming
* **Google Slides / Docs** – For structured reporting
* **Notion / Confluence** – If you're using it as your documentation hub
