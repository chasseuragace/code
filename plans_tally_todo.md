## üéØ **Backend Developer Focus Areas**

### **Priority 1: Critical Missing Backend APIs**

#### **1. Notifications System** üö®
**Original Plan**: "Notifications Page: Show status transitions"
**Backend Requirements**:
- [ ] **Notification Entity & Schema**
  - Notification types (application_status, interview_scheduled, etc.)
  - User targeting (candidate_id, agency_id)
  - Status tracking (sent, read, delivered)
  - Timestamp and expiry management
- [ ] **Notification APIs**
  - `GET /candidates/:id/notifications` - List notifications
  - `PUT /notifications/:id/read` - Mark as read
  - `GET /notifications/unread-count` - Badge count
- [ ] **Status Transition Triggers**
  - Application status changes ‚Üí notifications
  - Interview scheduling ‚Üí notifications
  - Job posting updates ‚Üí notifications
- [ ] **Real-time Integration**
  - WebSocket/SSE for live notifications
  - Push notification infrastructure setup

--- remarks on notificaitons 
- notifications are primarily related to candidates applicaion status 
    - status changes as per application woorkflow rulees 
        - we track application status changes histories when status are changes 
        - we need to prepare templates as per teh workflow stages for the content of ntification 
        - the plan is to haev a dedicated tab under the notificxation page s in the frontend 
            - what the other tabs shall be are not confirmed yet, which is fine as of now as we are planning to work with teh application status change as of now 
                - now then as per the workflow 
                    - applied 
                    - shortlisted 
                    - interview sccheduled 
                    - interview complete (pass / fail )
                        - for this we have notification tracking with previous stage next stage (here next state is the curretn stage after the change )
                        - in the notification we can compose messages with the following thing under context 
                            - job name 
                            - position title 
                            - agency name 
                            - employer name 
                            - tap launch the application detail page 
                                - this shows the job details along with the candidate's  application history timeline 
                        - some stages have some details like for interviwe schedue we nention documents , related information 
                        - we also support rescheduling an interview .
        - i invision hte page shwoing grouped notification for job applicaions 
            - hence here are not much difference wbeteeen the my Application page and the applicaiton workflow notifications , as the only difference is that notification is sent to candidate and notification redirects to the application details page 
                - the applicaitn detail shows all relevant information like we mentioned earlier along with the status change history / the timeline . 
        - so what we can do is intead of handeling notification , we can instead handel 
            -  my applications api 
            - get application details by application id obtained from the my application api 

        - how well begin with this 
            - check existing apis if we have endpoint/ service to list the applicaiton by candidate id 
            - check existing apis for presence of get application details given the applicaion id 
            - make sure that the api's provide ther respective well structured data .
