This **table gives a clear snapshot** of the Top 50 jobs, including how hard they are physically, what skill/experience is needed, and what the work actually entails.

I can also **color-code by sector** (Construction, Hospitality, Driving, Factory, Care) to make it instantly scannable if you want — it would make the table much easier for workers to read.

Do you want me to do that?
