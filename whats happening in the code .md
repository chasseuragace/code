Defining the artifacts 
- initialize on the /Users/ajaydahal/my-react-app
    - make sure i can use filesystem mcp to access things outside theis workspace as well
- document 
    - product requirement document 
        - the mmd files here /Users/ajaydahal/my-react-app/public/mermaid
            - serves the structure 
            - while hte workspace there ,  is someone , who 
                - who can do the mmd to ui rendering. 
                    - it calaim to do so. 
                    - i shall bear this state of mind when i inter the /Users/ajaydahal/my-react-app/public/mermaid workspace . 
            - to hvae entry to /Users/ajaydahal/my-react-app/public/mermaid i need a mermaid diagram that follows the convention of hte workspace . 
                - create mermainds , they have description 
                    - proper data for that exists 
                - pages exist showing how mermaind diagrams render 
                - it porvides a structure 
                    - that defines 
                        - where do i put hte files 
                        - how do i get hte view showing hte mmmd as component 
                        - how do i use it in a new page, 
                        - it itself is an example of 
                            - include in existing page 
                            - enlarge 
                            - full screen preview 
                - we need to curate pages as tabs 
                    - what are the relevant documents i planned for the demo 
                    - and so on 
                - after teh my-react-app now shows things , 
                    - i look at it
                        - plan more on it 
                        - when woudl be the next time iam here 
                            - next demo
